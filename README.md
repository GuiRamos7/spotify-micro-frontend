# Spotify Application with Micro-frontend


This is a clone of Spotify WEB did I made, but I used Webpack Module Federation. 
The Module Federation is responsible to create the integration between the builds, with it you can share you code (as components, logic, services), in run time and at the same time you keep your proccess of developing in paralel
<br/>
With this clone I created 3 micro-front-ends with sharing code bidirectionally, the idea is to break apart some parts of Spotify features in micro-frontends with that keep the responsibility apart too
